# ðŸŽ“ Student Performance Calculator (ML-Based)

This project is a **Machine Learning-based Student Performance Calculator** that predicts a **Performance Index** using a **Linear Regression** model. The model is trained on data including study hours, previous academic scores, extracurricular activity, sleep patterns, and practice intensity.

## ðŸ“Š Features

- Uses **Linear Regression** to estimate a Performance Index.
- Accepts the following input features:
  - **Hours Studied**
  - **Previous Scores** (out of 100)
  - **Extracurricular Activities** (e.g., 0 for No, 1 for Yes)
  - **Sleep Hours** (per day)
  - **Sample Question Papers Practiced**

## ðŸ§  Machine Learning Model

- **Algorithm**: Linear Regression
- **Target Variable**: Performance Index (score out of 100)
